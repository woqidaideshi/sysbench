.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_pr.h
.Ft void
.Fn ck_pr_fence_acqrel void
.Ft void
.Fn ck_pr_fence_strict_acqrel void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function enforces memory using both acquire and release ordering relative 
to the invocation of the function. Acquire ordering will prevent reordering
of preceding reads with subsequent reads or writes. Release ordering will 
prevent reordering of preceding reads or writes with subsequent writes.
On architectures with CK_MD_TSO (total store ordering), this operation only serves
as a compiler barrier and no fence instructions will be emitted.
Architectures implementing CK_MD_PSO or CK_MD_RMO (partial store ordering and relaxed memory ordering respectively)
always emit a fence.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
This function has no return value.
